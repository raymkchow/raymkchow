Hi I'm @raymkchow. Welcome. 

This is my space for 
- my learning notes, now mainly for courses of *GaTech OMSCS* (as I am a student starting Spring 2022) and tech job interviews.
- some of my thoughts, codes (and hopefully projects in the future) on risk management (mainly delinquency and debt collection), finance (low-frequency portfolio sizing & stock picking), and various other topics I feel the need to write.


Why GitHub?
- build online presence in the open-source community, as almost everyone is using it
- git for keeping me accountable and progress tracking
- tried stackoverflow in 2016-2017.
- it is free!


Why risk management, finance, OMSCS and tech job interviews?
- finance was my past job. I was a financial portfolio/index analyst that actively used data science tools for building rule-based investing & market benchmarking.
- risk management is my current career path. I am a data analyst for controlling debt collection strategies & actions, and process automation in a bank.
- OMSCS is for my number 1 interest. I am always curious about the logics behind machine learning models, and the applications of them.
- tech job interview is for my future career. I want to become a data scientist and am now learning towards the goal. Passing a technical interview becomes one of the essential requirement.
